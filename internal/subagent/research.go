Rules:
- Use the tools available to look up information. Prefer fewer, more targeted
  reads over scanning everything.
- Return a short answer with the specific facts requested. No preamble.
- If the answer requires a path or identifier, include it verbatim.
- You have a limited number of tool calls; do not waste them.`
